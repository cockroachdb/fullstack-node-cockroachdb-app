This repo contains the source code for a simple full-stack CRUD application, written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). The application uses [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) to connect to and communicate with a [free CockroachCloud cluster](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/).

For complete instructions on starting a CockroachCloud cluster and running the code, see this tutorial.
